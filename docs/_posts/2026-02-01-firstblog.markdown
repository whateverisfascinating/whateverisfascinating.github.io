First blog post, YAY!
I like the word YAY, it is perfectly symmetrical.

I am an *Italian mathematician* looking for a meaning in life, like everyone else.
I lived on this Earth for more than a quarter of a century, what a feat!
And yea, I will remain anonymous and genderless as of now, thank you very much.
I felt like trying this blog thing out, so I am currently doing it, but I do not plan to take this TOO seriously YET, y'know.

People around me tell me that I am good at writing, but I do not feel 100% sure about it.
I love writing while respecting the linguistic rules and exploiting the constraints.
Hm, rules and constraints, no wonder why I like maths.
Anyway, if I love writing, why not at least try writing a couple of "train-of-thoughts-y" posts?

Uh, how neat, I can use Markdown.
Markdown is top notch people, use it whenever you can.
PS Obsidian Markdown is a very neat application.

Ok, back on track, my mind. "O sommo Ingegno, [...] qui si parrà la tua Nobilitate".
Holy moly I am kind of losing it.
Sooo... Ok, I first tried using Bear.blog with an updated Terminal basic theme with the PT Sans Google Font, with a deep navy background (hexadecimal #122436), and with a pale yellow text (hexadecimal #EAEA90).
But now, look, a Github Page!
I can change the minima Jekyll theme directly from the corresponding folder on my PC, I will do it eventually...
Anyway, GitHub can provide me with a strong backup, so YAY for that!

Thank you for your attention and have a great rest of your day.

Possible future posts:
- fonts,
- readable colour palettes,
- audio formats,
- actually buying songs,
- "everything in the digital world is text",
- Trackmania and Tetris, my beloved.
- the art of compression and videogame graphics
- my search for the perfect water bottle
- my walk on February 1 2026.
- if I am really devoted, crazy, or dumb enough, I could also publish book chapters one post at a time and create a dedicated "book" page. Could you imagine that?!?!?!?
